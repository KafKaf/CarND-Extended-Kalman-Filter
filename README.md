# Extended Kalman Filter Project 
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project we will predict a moving object state(position and velocity) using extended kalman filter implemented in c++.

The model will try to predict the state of the object based on lidar and radar measurements over time, taking into account the inherent uncertainty of the model and measurements.
